## General Introduction

Since all of us use trains nearly every day, we are well aware of the problem that it takes too long to leave the train platforms 
because of human traffic jams in front of the stairs. Sometimes this crowd of people even results in missing the connecting train.
A real-world example - that two uf us experience daily - is the train S12, which goes from Winterthur to Zurich and almost everyone
gets on the train in Winterthur and gets out in Zurich. That leads to an enormous human traffic jam.

## The Model

In our social forced model, there are many simplifications, but all of them are only small ones. As mentioned before, we want to simulate
the situation you can observe especially with s-trains. Because of this, we assume that all of the people get out of the train
at the simulated station, and no person tries to get on the train at that station. This is a good assumption because in real
s-trains, as describe above, most of the travellers get out at the same station and nearly no person wants to get on the train
at this station. For the project we will use a agend based simulation with the simplifications mentioned above.

## Fundamental Questions

What influence has the shape of the stairs to the bottleneck in front of them? 
What is the optimal number, size and location of stairs on the train platform?
Is it better to place few big stairs or many small stairs on the train platform?

## Expected Results


We expect to find out that big stairs are more efficient than many small ones. 
We also expect that parallel shaped stairs are better than for example funnel shaped stairs, as you usually see them in
trainstations.
